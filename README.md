## ARK.io Translations

We have taken time to refactor whole website and with this modularize it for easier management (including language files). 
When new lines for translations will appear we'll put them at the beginning of the file so you can more easily see what hasn't been translated in your language.

## How-To (Current Languages)
* 1. Download ```<your-lang>.json``` file from this GitHub or edit here on GitHub
* 2. Open in your favorite text editor (eg. Notepad ++) or edit here on GitHub
* 3. Edit only second part of the line for example:
-  ```"A Wallet for Everyone": "A Wallet for Everyone",``` -> ```"A Wallet for Everyone": "Translate Here",```
* 4. Submit Pull-Request and wait till we merge

## How-To (New Langugages)

## Contributing

Translations are not part of normal development GitHub bounty. However new, untranslated languages will get some ARK tokens for whole translations of files. Join ARK slack and contact 'boldninja' before starting translating to new language to not duplicate any efforts if language is already in the works.
